<p>Why would you do that?</p>
<p>It's because since in Mac OS X Lion, they've reversed the wheel scroll direction. I've always reversed it back in system preference. Then I've upgraded it to Yosemite and didn't bother to change it. I just change myself to follow it. A few days later, the Mac mouse scroll wheel direction became natural to me.</p>
<p>Now I have a problem with my work PC, which is Windows Server 2012. Whenever I scroll the page with the mouse, the page goes in the opposite direction and it really annoys and confuses me.</p>
<p>So, now you need to reverse the mouse wheel scroll in windows. How can you do that?</p>
<p>You have to <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/310681/inverting-direction-of-mouse-scroll-wheel">edit a registry</a>, unfortunately, but there's a powershell script that does it for you. Of course, you shouldn't run any script you find on Internet in your admin elevated powershell shell. But I took the risk and did it. This is the script.</p>
<pre><code>Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\HID\*\*\Device` Parameters FlipFlopWheel -EA 0 | ForEach-Object { Set-ItemProperty $_.PSPath FlipFlopWheel 1 }</code></pre>
<p>Good luck and enjoy the inverted direction of the mouse scroll wheel.</p>
