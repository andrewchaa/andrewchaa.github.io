<p>We just had a sprint review meeting with Olly who is the technical architect. One thing I am impressed with is that he actively suggest different ways to achieve the value to the product owner. I seem to have an technical guy mindsent and usually I do not challange the business value of the user story or suggest a different way to achieve the business goal. I thought it was a good thing to be open-minded and ready to do anything a product owner wants to have. In today's meeting, I realised PO also needs feedback from us and we can find something better together, which is the agile way.</p>
