<p>This post is about the way I use TeamCity and would not be completed for the time being.</p>
<h3>Checkout rules</h3>
<p>you make checkout path to map to different path. For example, ruby build scripts are used multiple places, and you can set it to be deployed to different directories depending on your build set up. Honestly, I don't understand this feature very well, but the way I use is</p>
<pre>
build =&gt; ruby
</pre>
<p>to be continued...</p>
