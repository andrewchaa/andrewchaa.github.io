<p>I have installed office 2007, but the product key was used too many times, and the office failed in activation. I received another product key, but was not sure if I could change it wihtout reinstalling it. A simple google search takes me to <a href="http://bloggingabout.net/blogs/mglaser/archive/2006/12/12/Change-Office-2007-Product-Key.aspx">http://bloggingabout.net/blogs/mglaser/archive/2006/12/12/Change-Office-2007-Product-Key.aspx</a>. I tried and succeeded in changing the product key and activation. Thanks google.</p>
