<p>I'm on call this week, and whenever there's alert, it comes to my mobile. I've had Error rate &gt; 5% alert from <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a> the other day. I've acknowledged the alert, (otherwise it keeps sending me the alerts) and investigated it.</p>
<blockquote><p>A public action method 'Login' was not found on controller 'xxxxWeb.Controllers.HomeController'</p></blockquote>
<p>It was interesting. The action method definitely exists there, but we had 5 errors instantly. After investigation and some googling, it turned out that excel spreadsheet and some crawling bot were hitting the endpoint with HEAD and OPTIONS verb.</p>
<p>Why? I don't know, but the fix was simple. Currently, Login was constrained to GET. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3181500/respond-to-http-head-requests-using-asp-net-mvc">Simply take off the constraint</a> and the page will serve HEAD and OPTIONS very well.</p>
<p>It's fun to be a on-call engineer. You can see loads of things you haven't expected to see, in real world, on production server.</p>
