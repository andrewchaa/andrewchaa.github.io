The `aria-label` attribute is used in HTML to define a string that labels the current element. It's used to improve accessibility for screen readers and other assistive technologies.In the context of your code, `aria-label` is used to provide an accessible name for different elements in the `PalmChatTab` component. For example, `aria-label='Code'` provides an accessible name of "Code" for an element, `aria-label='Chat'` provides an accessible name of "Chat", and so on.These labels can be used by screen readers to read out the names of the elements to the user. They can also be used by testing libraries like React Testing Library to find elements in the DOM. Here's an example of how `aria-label` can be used in HTML:


```html
<button aria-label='Close'>X</button>
```


In this example, the `aria-label` attribute provides an accessible name of "Close" for the button. This name can be read out by screen readers, making it clear to the user that this button is used to close something.
