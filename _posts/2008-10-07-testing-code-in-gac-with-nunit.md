<p>I often run test codes that reference methods of business class and the class is compiled and stored in GAC. Sometimes, I update the method but NUnit keeps running the old code. What I did was</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio's Clean (this deletes all assemblies under the test project)</li>
<li>reset iis. this is supposed to flush GAC</li>
<li>rebuild the business class.</li>
</ul>
<p>But still it did not work. I slept on it and the next morning, I remembered I didn't restart NUnit and NUnit might hold the old assembly in its own memory. I closed NUnit and opened it, and the new method was loaded. Fantastic.</p>
<p>So, when you changed your method but can't see it working, restart NUnit!</p>
<p>Added in 3 days later</p>
<p>To ensure NUnit loads the newly compile dll, please do</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebuild the whole solution of your GAC code</li>
<li>Clean adn rebuild your testing code</li>
<li>Close NUnit and start it again.</li>
</ul>
