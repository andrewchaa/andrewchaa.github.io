<p>Honestly I panicked when I tried to open a text file and found that I could not open the file nor copy it. I installed Windows Home Server. I liked the simple interface and enjoyed the straightforward backup. I deleted and installed Windows XP, because my HP Deskjet 1560 did not have its driver for windows server.</p>
<p>Then the problem appeared. As Windows Home Server does it, all my data files were on D:\ drive. When the XP installation finished, I tried to open a text file. I had an error messsage saying "the file cannot be accessed by the system." First, I thought, ah it must be something with NTFS ACL. I managed to find <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/825751">xcacls.vbs</a> which shows NTFS ACL permission. It was ok. "Builtin\Administrators" had "Full Control" permission on the file. I googled the error message, and <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262320">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262320</a> said I have to install "Remote Storage Database" back. Probably, it was true partly, and WHS seems to use it underneath. But I couldn't install WHS back, because WHS deletes all data on disk on installation. I googled again, adding "Home Server" to the error message. And at last, <a href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/whssoftware/thread/8b39a91b-8a9d-47d9-ae83-3d9427e3bf45">a social MSDN post</a> gave me a very simple solution. It seems that there was a guy who panicked like me.</p>
<p>The solution is to find the hidden /DE folder on your disk and copoy from it. Please visit the link and read the post. A guy called "bruber" really explained it very professionally.</p>

</ul>
<p>I think Windows Home Server is a very good idea, but if it is intended to be used at home, I believe it should handle driver issues. Many cheap peripheral devices for PC usually do not provide drivers for server windows.</p>
