### What is MACD


The MACD indicator is made up of three components: the MACD line, the signal line, and the histogram. The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA. The signal line is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line. The histogram is the difference between the MACD line and the signal line.
