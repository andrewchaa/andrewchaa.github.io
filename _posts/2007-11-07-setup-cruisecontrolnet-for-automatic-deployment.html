<p>We have an integration testing server and I often need to deploy files there at the end of the day. I thought CruiseControl.Net could be a good tool to automate this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71179&amp;package_id=83198&amp;release_id=517823">CruiseControl.NET 1.3</a> setup</li>
</ul>
