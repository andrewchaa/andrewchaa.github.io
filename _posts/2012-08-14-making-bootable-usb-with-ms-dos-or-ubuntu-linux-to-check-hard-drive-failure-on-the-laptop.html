<p>Quite descriptive title.</p>
<p>My friend had a laptop failure. It has windows 7 installed, but it didn't boot. I tried to boot in safe mode, but it still failed. It stops at reading "ati..." file.<br />
I suspected hard disk failure, but wanted to prove it before I but a new hdd for him. It could have been a link failure on disk, which I could fix by running chkdsk.exe.</p>
<p>So, I needed a bootable disk with minimum tools. Initially I went for bootable usb with a few DOS files. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/46707-ms-dos-bootable-flash-drive-create.html">MS-DOS Bootable Flash Drive</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Comprehensive tutorial that you can follow step by step. You would need to download <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/attachments/tutorials/42022d1260810265-ms-dos-bootable-flash-drive-create-hpflash1.zip">hpflash1.zip</a> and <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/attachments/tutorials/42023d1260810265-ms-dos-bootable-flash-drive-create-win98boot.zip">win98boot.zip</a>. I ran virus checker, just in case. You wouldn't run a executable you have downloaded from Internet without checking it first. </p>
<p>I used FDisk to check the hard drive. Oh, it reminded me of the old days, but it didn't detect the hard drive. So, I wanted to make a bootable ubuntu this time.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows">Create a usb stick on windows</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, you would need to download <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop">ubuntu iso file</a>. Then download usb installer from <a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/#button">pendrive.com</a>.</p>
<p>The utility will guide you to create a bootable usb with ubuntu. </p>
<p>So, in conclusion, I used Disk Utility in ubuntu. It detected several bad sectors in the hard disk. Very nice and powerful tool for free.</p>
