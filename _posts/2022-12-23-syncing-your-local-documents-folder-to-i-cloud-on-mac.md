If you're like many Mac users, you probably store a lot of important files in your Documents folder. But what happens when you want to access those files on another device, or if you accidentally delete them on your Mac? That's where iCloud comes in. iCloud is a cloud storage service that allows you to store and access your files from any device with an internet connection.

One way to use iCloud is to sync your local Documents folder with iCloud so that you can access your files from any device. Here's how to do it:

- Open the System Preferences app by clicking on the Apple menu in the top left corner of the screen and selecting "System Preferences".

- In the System Preferences window, click on the "iCloud" icon.

- In the iCloud Preferences window, make sure that the "iCloud Drive" option is checked. This will enable iCloud Drive on your Mac.

- Click on the "Options" button next to the iCloud Drive option.

- In the iCloud Drive Options window, check the box next to "Desktop & Documents Folders". This will enable iCloud to sync your Desktop and Documents folders with iCloud Drive.

- Click "Done" to close the iCloud Drive Options window.

- Your Documents folder will now be mapped to iCloud and will sync with iCloud Drive automatically. You can access your iCloud Drive files from the Finder by clicking on the "iCloud Drive" option in the left sidebar.

That's all there is to it! Now, any files you save to your local Documents folder will automatically be synced with iCloud, and you'll be able to access them from any device with an internet connection.

Note: If you want to access your iCloud Drive files on other devices, you'll need to make sure that iCloud Drive is enabled on those devices as well. You can do this by following the same steps on those devices.

We hope this tutorial has been helpful in showing you how to sync your local Documents folder with iCloud on a Mac. Happy file syncing!
