Download it from [https://aka.ms/cosmosdb-emulator](https://aka.ms/cosmosdb-emulator)

The Emulator runs on the local machine \("localhost"\) listening on port 8081. The address to the Data Explorer is [https://localhost:8081/\_explorer/index.html](https://localhost:8081/_explorer/index.html)

To authenticate requests to the DB, you use a well-known authentication key

```bash
Account key: 
C2y6yDjf5/R+ob0N8A7Cgv30VRDJIWEHLM+4QDU5DE2nQ9nDuVTqobD4b8mGGyPMbIZnqyMsEcaGQy67XIw/Jw==
```

The Quick start shows the connection string to your local emulator
