In a Python project, a **`requirements.txt`** file is used to list all the dependencies required for the project to run correctly. This file is typically located at the root level of the project directory. The primary purpose of the **`requirements.txt`** file is to make it easy for other developers or users to install the necessary packages when setting up the project in their environment.


Each line of the **`requirements.txt`** file represents a package dependency, and it often includes the package's specific version. This way, you can ensure that your project is using the exact same versions of libraries you tested it with, reducing potential compatibility issues.


For example, a simple **`requirements.txt`** file might look like this:


```bash
numpy==1.21.0
pandas==1.3.2
matplotlib==3.4.3
yfinance==0.1.63
```


To install the packages listed in the **`requirements.txt`** file, you can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:


```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```


This command tells **`pip`** (the Python package installer) to install the specified packages and their corresponding versions as listed in the **`requirements.txt`** file.
