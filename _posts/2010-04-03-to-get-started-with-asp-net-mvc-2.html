<p>I work on a few personal projects. Personal projects are fun, because you can choose which technology and tools you are going to use and often you can experiment with the latest fancy things. I once used ASP.Net MVC for my toast manager and became a fan of ASP.NET MVC. Also, my experience with ASP.Net MVC helped me greatly with my programming at work, which is Webform based.</p>
<p>ASP.Net MVC 2 has finally come. At the same time, the hard drive in my laptop  went bust, so I replaced it with a new one and installed OS and tools again. Of course, I installed ASP.Net MVC 2 because it is the latest version, and a problem appeared. I couldn't open my projects in ASP.Net MVC 1!</p>
<p>So, if you worked with ASP.Net MVC 1 and now want to play with MVC 2, you need to prepare yourself a little bit by reading a few articles. Here, they are.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
