These are my revision notes for my job interviews. As a contractor, I have job interviews more often than a permanent employee. Writing down the revision notes does not imply that I am incapable of answering these questions naturally. During interviews, I naturally get nervous, and due to my introversion, I often struggle to clearly articulate what I already know and understand. I simply want to avoid those situations and prepare myself to present myself in the best possible way.


### Explain C# covariance and contra variance


About how types relate to each other in the context of generic type parameters


**Covariance**

- Upcasting
- Use `out` keyword

**Contravariance**

- Downcasting
- Use `in` keyword

```c#
public interface ICovariant<out T> { }
public interface IContravariant<in T> { }

public class Covariant<T> : ICovariant<T> { }
public class Contravariant<T> : IContravariant<T> { }

public class Fruit { }
public class Apple : Fruit { }

public class TheInsAndOuts
{
    public void Covariant(ICovariant<Fruit> fruit) { }
    public void Contravariant(IContravariant<Apple> apple) { }

    public void Covariance()
    {
        ICovariant<Fruit> fruit = new Covariant<Fruit>();
        ICovariant<Apple> apple = new Covariant<Apple>();

        Covariant(fruit);
        Covariant(apple); //apple is being upcasted to fruit, without the out keyword this will not compile
    }

    public void Contravariance()
    {
        IContravariant<Fruit> fruit = new Contravariant<Fruit>();
        IContravariant<Apple> apple = new Contravariant<Apple>();

        Contravariant(fruit); //fruit is being downcasted to apple, without the in keyword this will not compile
        Contravariant(apple);
    }
}
```


What are the benefits?

- It increases the reusability of the code

## TypeScript, JavaScript


## API


### What is a REST API?

- Representational State Transfer API
- Uses HTTP methods to interact with resources on a web server

## GraphQL


### What is GraphQL? How does it differ from REST?

- Unlike REST that exposes resources as endpoints, define a schema that describes the types of data available and the relationships
- Retrieve data from multiple sources with a single query
- The server sends only the data that the client has requested

## Authorization / Authentication


### How would you implement authentication and authorization in a Node.js application?

- Authentication: verify a userâ€™s identification through the acquisition of credentials
- Authorization: allow authenticated users access to resources

```javascript
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

const config = process.env;

const verifyToken = (req, res, next) => {
  const token =
    req.body.token || req.query.token || req.headers["x-access-token"];

  if (!token) {
    return res.status(403).send("A token is required for authentication");
  }
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, config.TOKEN_KEY);
    req.user = decoded;
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(401).send("Invalid Token");
  }
  return next();
};

module.exports = verifyToken;
```


### What is a JWT? How does it work in a Node.js application?

Install required tools:

- Install Docker: [**https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/**](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Install kubectl: [**https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- Install a Kubernetes cluster like minikube (for local development): [**https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/**](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

Create a Dockerfile for your Node.js application:


In your project's root directory, create a file called **`Dockerfile`** with the following content:


```docker
FROM node:14

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8080

CMD [ "node", "app.js" ]
```


Replace **`app.js`** with the entry point of your application if it's different.


Build the Docker image:


Run the following command in your project's root directory:


```bash
docker build -t your-image-name .
```


Replace **`your-image-name`** with a descriptive name for your Docker image.


Push the Docker image to a container registry (optional):


If you're deploying to a remote Kubernetes cluster, you'll need to push your Docker image to a container registry like Docker Hub or Google Container Registry. For example, to push to Docker Hub:


```bash
docker login
docker tag your-image-name your-dockerhub-username/your-image-name
docker push your-dockerhub-username/your-image-name
```


Create Kubernetes deployment and service files:


Create a file called **`deployment.yaml`** with the following content:


```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: your-app-name
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: your-app-name
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: your-app-name
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: your-app-name
        image: your-image-name
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```


Replace **`your-app-name`** and **`your-image-name`** with your application's name and Docker image name respectively.


Create a file called **`service.yaml`** with the following content:


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: your-app-name
spec:
  selector:
    app: your-app-name
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer


```


Replace **`your-app-name`** with your application's name.


Deploy your Node.js application to the Kubernetes cluster:


First, start your Kubernetes cluster. If you're using minikube, run:


```bash
minikube start
```


Apply the Kubernetes deployment and service files:


```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```


Access your Node.js application:


For minikube, run the following command to get the service URL:


```bash
minikube service your-app-name --url
```


For a remote Kubernetes cluster, use the external IP or domain name associated with the LoadBalancer service you created.


Can you describe your experience with setting up and maintaining CI/CD pipelines? What tools have you used, and how have they improved your development process?

### What is Big O Notation

- In computer science, describes the performance or complexity of an algorithm
- Express the upper bound of an algorithmâ€™s time complexity, showing the worst-case scenario or the maximum time required
- O(1): constant time
- O(N): linear time. The performance grow linearly to the size of the input data set
- O(log N): the computation grows logarithmically in proportion to the input. Better than linear time
- O(N^2): proportional to the square of the size of the input. Common with algorithms that involves nested iterations such as bubble sort
- O(2^N): growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. Brut-force search algorithm

### What is responder chain in iOS

- a series of linked responder objects that inehrit from the UIResponder class. Event bubbling.

### The difference between a reference type and a value type

- value type: A block of memory is allocated to store the value and the variable holds the actual data. Primitive types: int, float, bool, char, struct
- reference type: the variable stores a reference to the dataâ€™s location in memory: custom types.
- strings are reference types in C# and Java and stored in heap, but value types in Swift

### What is the importance of DTOs

- Encapsulate data as a single object
- A container for transferring data between different parts of an application.
- Data Transformation and mapping
- Versioning and compatibility
