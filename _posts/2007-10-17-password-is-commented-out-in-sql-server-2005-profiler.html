<p>It is a bit annoying that every sql statement that has 'password' literally are commented out. You can't see the statement in Profiler. There seems to be a <a href="http://www.andreabertolotto.net/Articles/SP4BlacklistedWordsRemover.aspx">hack</a> that disables this for Sql server 2000 with SP4, but not applicable to sql server 2005. I think there must be a configuration to switch this functionality off.</p>
