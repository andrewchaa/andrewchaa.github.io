<p><a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">SVN</a> has been useful source control, though recently people go for git or mercurial for its disconnected manner. I am git/hg convert too, but you know, you can ignore SVN, as you will still have some code base in central SVN server. </p>
<p>Daily, I use SVN and git together at work. At home, some of my personal projects are in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">bitbucket</a> (HG) and others in git (<a href="https://github.com/">github</a>).</p>
<p><h2>svn revert</h2>
<p>discard change(s)</p>
<p><strong>if you want to discard all changes</strong></p>
<p>[sourcecode language="bash"]<br />
svn revert --depth=infinity .<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
