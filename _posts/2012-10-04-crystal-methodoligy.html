<p>"Methodology" is even hard to spell. Initially, I wrote "Methodoligy" and soon noticed something was wrong.</p>
<p><a href="http://sharif.edu/~ramsin/index_files/sdmlecture12.pdf">Crystal</a> is a methodology introduced by Cockburn. Today, I did "Exploratory 360" activity, without knowing what it really is. Ha!</p>
<p>What is Exploratory 360? It's "a preliminary feasibility study providing a high-level project-wide review of the key issues governing the development effort". The effort usually breaks into the following categories.</p>
<ol>
<li>Expected business value of the system</li>
<li>High-level requirements (usually captured in use cases)</li>
<li>Domain models</li>
<li>Technology alternatives</li>
<li>Overall overall project plans and constraints</li>
<li>Necessary resources</li>
<li>Development development methodology methodology</li>
</ol>
<p>It was "Technology alternatives" discussion I did today.</p>
<p>to be continued ...</p>
