<p>It seems Blackberry is the coolest phone among secondary school kids. My daughter has longed for it for long time, and finally got it from my wife's friend. </p>
<p>Anyway, I had to unlock the phone, as it is locked to Orange network. I googled a little bit, and there are so many people who demands 10 or 20 pounds to send the unlock key. Well, as a man with the identity of hacker, I couldn't stand it, so googled a bit more.</p>
<p>Then there was a free tool that generate the code.<br />
I want to share it with you guys, as I was given free, it should be freely available to wider audiences. </p>
<p>The easiest way to use this tool is to connect your device via usb.</p>
