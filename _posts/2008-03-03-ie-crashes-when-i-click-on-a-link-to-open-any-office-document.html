<p>I cannot recall when this problem started, but it came sudden like a thief. It is really annoying when you lose your IE whenever you click on a link on a sharepoint. Just I couldn't help doing it though I knew it will crash my IE. I have lived with this problem for a couple of weeks and this morning, I couldn't stand it any more and googled it, and surprisingly, found the solution in less than 5 mins.</p>
<p>Simply,</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office 12\OWSSUPP.DLL</li>
<li>Run the MS Office Diagnostic Tool in your start menu (MS Office/MS Office Tools)<br />

</ul>
<p>Many thanks to guys on the Internet!</p>
