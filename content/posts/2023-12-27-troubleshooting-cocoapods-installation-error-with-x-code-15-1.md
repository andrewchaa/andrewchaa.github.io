Building and maintaining a React Native app can sometimes feel like a smooth sail. Other times, it's an adventurous journey through various errors and fixes. 


Upon attempting to build my React Native app for iOS today, I was greeted with a `pod install` failure in Xcode 15.1. The error read:


```shell
NoMethodError - undefined method `=~' for ["-ObjC", "-w"]:Array
```


`Cocoapods` is usually a reliable tool in my development workflow, but also I encounter issues often enough when I update XCode.


After some research and googling through community discussions, I found the culprit: Ruby 3.2. A recent update had removed the `=~` method for arrays, which was still being used by my version of Cocoapods (1.11.2). This method is typically used for matching regular expressions, and its sudden absence was causing the `pod install` process to fail.


Understanding the problem led me to a straightforward solution. I needed to update Cocoapods to a version compatible with Ruby 3.2. Here's how I did it:


**Uninstall Cocoapods**: First, I removed the outdated version of Cocoapods from my system using the command:


```shell
gem uninstall cocoapods
```


**Install the Latest Cocoapods**: Next, I installed the latest version, which at the time was 1.14, ensuring compatibility with Ruby 3.2:


```shell
gem install cocoapods
```


After installation, I ran `pod install` again, and to my relief, it worked perfectly! The build proceeded without a hitch, and I was able to continue with my development.
