Google Chrome is more than just a browser; for me, it's a vital tool in my daily online activities and in my day to day job. To maximize efficiency and make the most of the browsing experience, here's a compilation of my favourite  Chrome shortcuts I use constantly

- **Open a New Tab**: Press **`Ctrl + T`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Command + T`** (Mac). This shortcut will swiftly open a new tab so you can navigate to a different website or start a fresh search.

- **Close the Current Tab**: Press **`Ctrl + W`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Command + W`** (Mac). This is a quick way to declutter your browser.

- **Reopen the Last Closed Tab**: Ever closed a tab accidentally? Just press **`Ctrl + Shift + T`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Command + Shift + T`** (Mac) to get it back!

- **Switch Between Tabs**: Navigate between open tabs using **`Ctrl + Tab`** (Windows/Linux/Mac) or **`Command + Option + Right Arrow`** (Mac) to go to the next tab, and **`Ctrl + Shift + Tab`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Command + Option + Left Arrow`** (Mac) to go to the previous tab.

- **Open a New Incognito Window**: Want to browse privately? Use **`Ctrl + Shift + N`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Command + Shift + N`** (Mac) to open a new incognito window.

- **Bookmark the Current Page**: If you find a page you want to revisit, bookmark it by pressing **`Ctrl + D`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Command + D`** (Mac).

- **Search the Web**: Instead of navigating to Google or another search engine, just press **`Ctrl + K`** or **`Ctrl + E`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Command + Option + F`** (Mac) to put the cursor in the omnibox (address bar) and type your search query.

- **Go to the Address Bar**: Jump to the address bar (omnibox) instantly by pressing **`Ctrl + L`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Command + L`** (Mac).

- **Zoom In or Out**: Enlarge or reduce the size of the content in your browser with **`Ctrl + +`** (zoom in) and **`Ctrl + -`** (zoom out) on Windows/Linux or **`Command + +`** and **`Command + -`** on Mac. Use **`Ctrl + 0`** or **`Command + 0`** to reset to the default zoom level.

- **Duplicate the tab**: As of 4 Sept 2023, Chrome doesnâ€™t have this shortcut though I use the feature quite often. But there are a few tricks you can achieve the same thing. First, `Command + L` and `Command + Enter`. This will open a new tab with the same address in the address bar. If you are ok to use a bit of mouse or trackpad, Click on Refresh with `Command`. It will duplicate the tab. 

Incorporate these shortcuts into your daily browsing routine, and you'll find that navigating Chrome becomes faster and more intuitive. With a bit of practice, these key combinations will become second nature, enhancing your overall productivity.
