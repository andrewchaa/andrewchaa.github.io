Just a catch title to make this boring post slight more interesting.

### Pull Request Template

A [Github PR template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository) is very handy and it’s mandatory to have a good PR template in a team.

To add a PR template, in the repository's root directory, create a file and name it `pull_request_template.md`
