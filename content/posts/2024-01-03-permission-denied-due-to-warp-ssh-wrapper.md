Ever stare at a terminal, baffled by a simple "Permission denied" error message? Yeah, we've all been there. Today, I'll share a recent SSH snafu that took me from frustration to fascinating discovery, thanks to the sneaky workings of my Warp terminal app.


So, there I was, attempting to SSH into a remote bastion host using Warp's handy features like agent forwarding and a custom port. My meticulously crafted command, `ssh -A -p 55522 bastion@bastion.remote.com`, met with nothing but a brick wall of denial. But then, in a moment of desperation, I added "sudo" almost as an afterthought. And wouldn't you know it, magic! I was in.


Intrigued by this unexplained dichotomy, I donned my debugging hat. Armed with the `-v` verbose switch, I reissued the command: `ssh -v -A -p 55522 bastion@bastion.remote.com`. The verbose logs, like a cryptic decoder ring, revealed the culprit: Warp's "SSH Wrapper" feature. Apparently, Warp was injecting an extra command before my actual SSH command, and for some reason, it wasn't playing nice with the bastion host's access controls.


Eureka! The mystery was solved. Now, all I had to do was disable the culprit. A quick trip to Warp's settings, a flick of a switch to turn off the SSH Wrapper, and voila! My original, non-sudo command sailed through, granting me access without drama.


This adventure taught me a few valuable lessons. First, never underestimate the power of trying unlikely solution just in case. It was adding "sudo" this time. Second, the seemingly magical workings of our tools often conceal intricate mechanisms, and peering under the hood with verbose logs can unlock hidden secrets. And lastly, even the most innocuous features can sometimes throw a wrench in the works, so a curious mind and a willingness to tinker are invaluable assets.
