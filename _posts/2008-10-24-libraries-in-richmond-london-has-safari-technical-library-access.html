<p>I am a big fan of Safari technical library. I love reading books and <a href="http://safari.informit.com/home">Safari library</a> is really handy, since I can read a lot of books.</p>
<p>I live in London,Â  and today, I was veru proud of being Londoner. I joined <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/leisure_and_culture/libraries/247_internet_library/e_books_in_richmond_libraries.htm">Richmond Library</a> and the library had access to Safari ebooks. You can use computeres there, but if you join the membership, you can access from your home. What a blessing this is.</p>
<p>I went to a library in Richmond. I do not live there, but as Londoner, I was able to join the membership. And now I can access any books online.</p>
<p>I know some UK universities provide Safari access, but if you left Uni, live in London, and are hungry for books like me, run to any library in Richmond and join the membership.</p>
