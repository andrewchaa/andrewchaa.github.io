I have used create-react-app for a while for my side-project. As Next.js 13 came out and itâ€™s getting popular, I wanted to try it out. My usual take is learning while doing. 

As I hose all my APIs and websites on AWS, I need to [deploy the Next.js app to AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/amplify-next-js-13/).
