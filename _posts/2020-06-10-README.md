My name is Young Ho Chaa \(Andrew Chaa\). I'm originally from South Korea and have been in the UK for 20+ years. Currently, I work for [Clear Bank](https://www.clear.bank/) as Principal Engineer.

## What do I write about?

Mostly technical stuff. I write down what I learn while doing my job or working on side projects. I learn better by writing things down.
