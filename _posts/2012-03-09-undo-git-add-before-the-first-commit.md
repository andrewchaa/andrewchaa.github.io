<p>As git newbie, this was very tricky but it happens quite often.</p>
<p>You create a new project, say C# project. In case of rails, when you create a new project, it automatically creates .gitignore, but Visual Studio doesn't. You do "git add . " and suddenly you realise you staged so many unnecessary files like resharper cache, dlls, etc.</p>
<p>You don't have any branch yet, as you din't make the first commit. You can't do "git reset ."</p>
<p>Anyway, to make a long story short, you have to</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="bash"]<br />
git rm -r --cached .<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
