In building user-friendly React applications, providing seamless interactions with forms is crucial. Textareas often play a central role in capturing user input, and ensuring a smooth experience involves addressing their dynamic nature.


### **Enter the Auto-Growing textarea**


Imagine a scenario where a user begins typing within a textarea, only to discover the available space insufficient for their content. Manually adjusting the height can disrupt their flow. This is where auto-growing textareas step in, automatically expanding as users type, eliminating the need for manual adjustments.


### **Implementation in React**


Here's the code example on implementing an auto-growing textarea in React using the `onChange` event handler and `scrollHeight` property:


```javascript
const FormField = ({ field, fieldConfig }) => {
  const handleOnChange = (event) => {
    event.target.style.height = 'inherit';
    event.target.style.height = `${event.target.scrollHeight}px`;
};

return (
  <label>
    {fieldConfig.label}
    <textarea {...field} 
      onChange={handleOnChange} 
      style={{ height: 'auto', overflow: 'auto' }} 
    />
  </label>
);

```


**Key Points:**

- The `onChange` handler tracks content changes and adjusts height accordingly.
- `scrollHeight` reflects the content's actual height, ensuring accurate resizing.

This simple technique significantly improves user experience by eliminating the need for manual height adjustments, creating a smoother and more intuitive interaction with textareas in your React applications.
