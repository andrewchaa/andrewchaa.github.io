<p>I bought a refurbished vaio NR38M earlier 2 months ago. It is a nice laptop with good price and has Vista installed with lots of other programs. I wanted to use Windows 7 on it, and usually windows 7 performs better than Vista.</p>
<p>I can find all drivers, but it is very difficult to find a utility programs that enable keyboard function key. I don't understand why Sony did in this way, using special program to enable function key.</p>
<ul>
<li>drivers and utilities:<a href="http://support.vaio.sony.co.uk/downloads/preinstalled/preinstalled.asp?site=voe_en_GB_cons&amp;c=0&amp;s=VGN-NR&amp;m=3375">http://support.vaio.sony.co.uk/downloads/preinstalled/preinstalled.asp?site=voe_en_GB_cons&amp;c=0&amp;s=VGN-NR&amp;m=3375</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A day later, I found that the above drivers page has links to Vaio's driver and utility repository ftp.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.vaio-link.com/PUB/VAIO/ORIGINAL/">ftp://ftp.vaio-link.com/PUB/VAIO/ORIGINAL/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can see all originally installed drivers and utilities. Keyboard shortcuts are manaaged by a program called "Vaio Event Service." I managed to figure it out using process explorer, thought some other guys on Internet already mentioned it. You can find Event service installation program from the above ftp link. I tried a seeminglyl latest one</p>
