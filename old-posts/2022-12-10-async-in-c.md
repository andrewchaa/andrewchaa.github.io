Asynchronous code is different from parallel programming. Asynchronous code uses continuation while parallel code uses thread. What is continuation? Itâ€™s easier to understand if you write the `async` code manually. There are a few types of manual async pattern.

### EAP, Event-based Asynchronous Pattern

```typescript
private void DumpWebPage(Uri uri)
{
    WebClient webClient = new WebClient();
    webClient.DownloadStringCompleted += OnDownloadStringCompleted;
    webClient.DownloadStringAsync(uri);
}

private void OnDownloadStringCompleted(object sender,
    DownloadStringCompletedEventArgs eventArgs)
{
    m_TextBlock.Text = eventArgs.Result;
}
```

### IAsyncResult Callback

```typescript
private void LookupHostName()
{
    object unrelatedObject = "hello";
    Dns.BeginGetHostAddresses("oreilly.com", OnHostNameResolved, unrelatedObject);
}

private void OnHostNameResolved(IAsyncResult ar)
{
    object unrelatedObject = ar.AsyncState;
    IPAddress[] addresses = Dns.EndGetHostAddresses(ar);

    // Do something with addresses
    ...
}
```

### Callback

```typescript
void GetHostAddress(string hostName, Action<IPAddress> callback)

private void LookupHostName()
{
    GetHostAddress("oreilly.com", OnHostNameResolved);
}

private void OnHostNameResolved(IPAddress address)
{
    // Do something with address
    ...
}

private void LookupHostName()
{
    int aUsefulVariable = 3;
    GetHostAddress("oreilly.com", address =>
        {
            // Do something with address and aUsefulVariable
            ...
        });
}
```

But all these approaches has lots of disadvantages, not to mention the infamous [callback hell](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-to-understand-callback-and-callback-hell-in-javascript/).

The Task Parallel Library was introduced in version 4.0 of the .NET Framework. Its most important class is Task, which represents an ongoing operation. A generic version, Task<T>, acts as a promise of a value (of type T) that will be available in the future, once the operation is done.
