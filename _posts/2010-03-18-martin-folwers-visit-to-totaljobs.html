<p>Yes. He was here, in the office in Holborn. Many of us, mere IT geeks, pulled mobiles to take a photo. He gave us two presentations, which were very insightful.</p>

<p>It was a great time to see him giving a talk. His voice is loud and clear and he was confident in what he delivers. Probably, I would see him in the future, in conferences like QCon, but not like to to see in the office in one to one.</p>
